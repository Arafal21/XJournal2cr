## üî• 3. Application features & approache:

-   ‚úÖ Application Description:
    A School Electronic Journal application streamlines communication and organization in schools by providing a centralized platform for managing student records, grades, attendance, and assignments. It allows teachers to easily update class information, parents to track their child‚Äôs progress in real-time, and students to stay informed about their performance and homework. With secure access for principals, teachers, parents, and students, the app fosters transparency and collaboration while reducing paperwork and administrative workload.
    Grades: information that it is in the European system of 1-6, than the American system of A-F

    Parent: ...
    Student: ...

-   ‚úÖ Applications features:

-   ‚úÖ Why this approach and not another to a problem. A/B/C/D

-   ‚úÖ Gifs

The application is suitable for large screens >=992px (laptop, computer) and phones 320px-400px????????????????????????????????? without tablets because they are the least used.
In the project there are no ‚Äúless necessary‚Äù functionalities like adding school subjects, because sometimes you can't see the end of how much you can expand something, and the application focuses on the key and most important functions. My colleagues helped me for free have their own jobs and did it outside of working hours so they have limited time, so there is functionality as much as there is. once again, thank you very much I am grateful to you for such excellent cooperation and great respect! I hope that soon we will make xjournal even more extensive!
